/*

Free font services, like Google Fonts and Adobe Fonts, host fonts that you 
can link to from your HTML document with a provided <link> element.

You can also use fonts from paid font distributors like fonts.com by downloading 
and hosting them with the rest of your site’s files. You can create a @font-face 
ruleset in your CSS stylesheet to link to the relative path of the font file.

Both techniques for including web fonts into your site allow you to go beyond 
the sometimes “traditional” appearance of web safe fonts.
